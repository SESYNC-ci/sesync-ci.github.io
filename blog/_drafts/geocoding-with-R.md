Data is not perfect. We all know that. A little while ago I stumbled into an [Annotated Honey Bee Images](https://www.kaggle.com/jenny18/honey-bee-annotated-images) dataset form [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and decided to map it, except I couldn't map it right away.  
The dataset included text for the city names where the images were collected, but not the latitude and longitude coordinates needed to map the locations.  
I decided to perform some geocoding to get the coordinates for each location to map the bees!

## What is geocoding?

Geocoding is the process of converting addresses/places into geographic coordinates which can be used to place markers on a map.  
For example, by geocoding "Squamish, British Columbia, Canada" you can say that "Squamish" can be found at (49.701634, -123.155812) latitude and longitude coordinates.
You can geocode address, cities, dog parks, countries, pretty much any place you can think of! 

## What geocoding tools are available?

One option, maybe the most obvious one, is the Google Maps API.  
To be able to access this API, you need to create an account on the Google Cloud Platform and get an API key.  
Google provides detailed instructions on how to do it [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started). 

Another option is to use [Nominatim](http://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/api/Overview/), a public API from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about).  
OpenStreetMap is an open-source collaborative project aimed to create free map services for the public.  
Nominatim does not require you to register and get an API key. It does have its limits if you want to use it extensively in an application -- OSM server's have limits after all. 

## Why geocode with R?

Geocoding and mapping data with R instead of a web or GIS application brings the general advantages of using a programming language in analyzing and visualizing data.  
With R, you can write the code once and use it over and over, while also providing a record of all your steps in the creation of a map.  
The R community has created a few packages, which can be used for accessing the Google Map and Nominatim APIs. Letâ€™s have a look on them.

## Using ggmap with the Google Map API to Geocode 

[`ggmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/readme/README.html) is a package for R, which enables the creation of maps with [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).

You will first need to register your Google API key using the `register_google()` function part of the `ggmap` package.  
To geocode the locations of a dataset use the `mutate_geocode()` function from the `ggmap` package.  
`mutate_geocode()` requires a data frame with a column containing the locations to geocode.  
The goal then is to get a data frame with all the distinct locations and geocode them.  
We then join our original data frame with the gocoded data frame of distinct locations and just like that every observations in your main dataset will have latitude and longitude coordinates which can be mapped.

### *Example*
Register your Google Map API Key
```r
register_google(key = <GoogleAPIKey>)
```

Get a data frame of distinct locations
```r
bee_data <- read_csv("data/bee_dataset.csv")

# get the distinct locations from the dataset and create a data frame
locations_txt <- distinct(bee_data, location)
locations_txt <- as.data.frame(locations_txt)
head(locations_txt)

#>      location
#>  1   Alvin, TX, USA
#>  2   Saratoga, CA, USA
#>  3   Athens, GA, USA
#>  4   San Jose, CA, USA
#>  5   New Orleans, LA, USA
#>  6   Des Moines, IA, USA
#>  7   Keene, NH, USA
```

Geocode with `mutate_geocode()`
The first argument in `mutate_geocode()` is the data frame of distinct locations    
The second argument is the column containing the location names  
`mutate_geocode()` returns a a geocoded data frame of locations
```r
locations_geo <- mutate_geocode(locations_txt, location)
head(locations_geo)

#>      location                lon         lat
#>  1   Alvin, TX, USA          -95.24410   29.42385
#>  2   Saratoga, CA, USA       -122.02301  37.26383
#>  3   Athens, GA, USA         -83.35757   33.95193
#>  4   San Jose, CA, USA       -121.88633  37.33821
#>  5   New Orleans, LA, USA    -90.07153   29.95107
#>  6   Des Moines, IA, USA     -93.62496   41.58684
#>  7   Keene, NH, USA          -72.27814   42.93369
```

Join the geocoded data frame with the original data frame
```r
bee_data_joined <- left_join(bee_data, locations_geo, by = "location")
bee_data_joined[1,]
#>      file               location            zip code    subspecies      health              caste       lon         lat
#>  1   041_066.png        Alvin, TX, USA      77511       -1              hive being robbed   worker      -95.24410   29.42385
```

## Using tmaptools package and the Nominatim API to geocode 

[`tmaptools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmaptools/tmaptools.pdf) is a package for R, which enables the reading and processing of spatial data.  
Many of the `tmaptools` functions rely on the Nominatim API. Nominatim is free and open source and there is no need for an API key. 

The workflow for using `tmaptools` to geocode is similar to the `ggmap` workflow.  
To geocode the locations of a dataset use the `geocode_OSM()` function from the `tmaptools` package.  
Let's use `tmaptools` to get the same coordinate information we extracted using `ggmap`.

### *Example* 
After getting the data frame with the distinct locations, geocode using the `tmaptools` package. 

Geocode with `geocode_OSM()`
The first argument in `geocode_OSM()` is the data frame columns containing the text locations   
We set `details` to **false** becasue we are only interested in the coordinates  
We set `as.data.frame` to **true** in order to get a data frame back. 
```r
nominatim_loc_geo <- geocode_OSM(locations_txt$location,
                              details = FALSE, as.data.frame = TRUE)
```

You will notice that `geocode_OSM()` returns a data frame containing latitude, longitude, and maximums and minimums coordinates. 
```r
# display first row
nominatim_loc_geo[1,]

#>      query               lat         lon         lat_min     lat_max     lon_min     lon_max
#>  1   Alvin, TX, USA      29.42385    -95.24410   29.06809    29.50237    -95.58356   -95.05651
```

We are interested in the **lat** and **lon** columns for each observation.  
Drop the **min** and **max** columns and rename the **query** column before joining.
```r
# keep the first 3 columns (query, lat, lon)
nominatim_loc_geo <- nominatim_loc_geo[,1:3]

# rename query to location
```r
nominatim_loc_geo <- nominatim_loc_geo %>% 
  rename(
    query = location
    )
```

Join the geocoded data frame with the original data set. 
```r
bee_data_joined <- left_join(bee_data, nominatim_loc_geo, by = "location")
bee_data_joined[1,]
```

## Conclusion

We have successfully geocoded the locations from where the bee observations where taken.

We have covered:
- how to use the `ggmap` package with the Google Map API to perform geocoding.
- how to use the `tmaptools` package with the Nominatim API to perform geocoding.

You can now map your geolocated observations using your favorite mapping package!
