# How we do science has changed due to the global pandemic

When and how scientists could safely collect data under pandemic protocols (both
in the field and in the lab) changed dramatically, which led some researchers
to turn to existing open datasets to try and answer the same or similar research questions.  
These new or renewed efforts to use and reuse existing datasets exposed on-going
hurdles to using these data, and prompted re-examination of what makes a dataset 
truly open and accessible.  

# The opportunity 

A discussion about making and using open data seemed timely, so Cassandra Glaspie, 
Assistant Professor in the Oceanography and Coastal Sciences at Louisiana State University, 
convened an [Inspire session](https://www.esa.org/longbeach/program/inspire-schedule/) at 
the Ecological Society of Americam meeting, held virtually August 2-6, 2021.  After chatting 
with Dr. Glaspie, the data science team at SESYNC thought that this topic fit very well 
with what we do, and that this was an important topic to our researchers across all career stages. 

# Highlights from the talk

- Available open datasets are increasing
- Open data still doesn’t always mean accessible or usable data - let’s change that!
- Ability to programmatically download data can increase access and reproducibility
- Making data consistent, ordered, organized, and well documented can increase reuse
- To make data widely usable, think about interdisciplinary connections across scales when designing disciplinary research projects
- To make data re-usable, think about what information someone else would need to be able to reuse your research data?
