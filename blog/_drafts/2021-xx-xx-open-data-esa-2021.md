# The pandemic has changed how we do science

The global pandemic dramatically changed when and how scientists could 
collect data both in the field and in the lab, which led to some researchers
turning to existing open datasets to try and answer the same or similar questions.  
These new or renewed efforts to use and reuse existing datasets exposed on-going
hurdles to using these data, and prompted re-examination of what makes a dataset 
truly open and accessible.  

some people were not able to collect data
reliance on existing data
need that data to be open and accessible
this is important across all career stages

# The opportunity to talk about this during ESA seemed timely
