```{r include = FALSE}

```

Tweaking figures for presentations or publications can be a tedious process, especially when I always need a reminder on "how to use greek letters or subscripts in y-axis", "remove legend", and "r pch". Here are a collection of some `ggplot2` functions and arguments that I find particularly useful and want to remember. 

### Getting oriented with proper axes

Within an `xlab()` or `ylab()` function, use `expression(paste())` to use special characters. Use brackets (`[]`) for subscript, the caret (`^`) for superscript, and the names of greek letters e.g. `mu`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  ylab(expression(paste("C", H[4], " (", mu,"mol ", L^-1,")"))) +
  xlab(expression(paste("DOC (mg ", L^-1,")")))
```

* Customize date axes with `scale_x_date()`
* Rotate axis labels 90 degrees and right justify using the layer `theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))`
* Display axis tick labels as percentages with `scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)`. To round the percentages to the nearest whole number, use `scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))`.

### Show me the data!

* Map aesthetics to specific shapes using `scale_shape_manual()` with arguments values and labels:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21, 24), 
                     name = element_blank(),
                     labels = c("Landsat", "Sentinel2"))
```

* As described in detail on the [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Plotting_means_and_error_bars_(ggplot2)/) website, vertically oriented error bars can be added to a plot using `geom_errorbar()`. The necessary aesthetics are `ymin` and `ymax`, and usually I adjust the `width` to 0.1 or 0.2. Use `geom_errorbarh()` with `xmin` and `xmax` for horizontal error bars (or rotate the whole plot with `coord_flip()`).

* Smooth out density plot using the `adjust` argument in `geom_density`

* Zoom in without losing outlier data points using `coord_cartesian()`

* Alternatively, lose the outliers on a boxplot with `geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)`

### Special text and labels

* To display a statistic like $R^2 = 0.75$ on a plot, it is better to code the value of $R^2$ as a variable rather than manually typing it in. Here is how you can do this with ggplot's `annotate()` function. You will need to include `parse = TRUE` as an argument so that the string is converted to a plotmath expression.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
set.seed(222)
mydata <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 1:10 + rnorm(10, sd = 2))
fit <- lm(y ~ x, data = mydata)
rsq_label <- paste('R^2 == ', round(summary(fit)$r.squared, 2))

ggplot(mydata, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE, size = 1.5) +
  annotate(geom = 'text', x = -Inf, y = Inf, label = rsq_label, hjust = 0, vjust = 1, parse = TRUE)
```

* To put text labels exactly in the corner or on the edge of the plot area, you can use `Inf` or `-Inf` as coordinate values. This is also illustrated in the example above. Note that you have to change the `hjust` and `vjust` arguments as well. 

* If you have a faceted plot there are a lot of ways to customize the labels that appear along the facet margins. To use expressions in the facet labels you can use `label_parsed`. Notice that you have to format the labels as expressions, which includes replacing spaces with `~`.

```{r}
mydata <- data.frame(y = 1:10, variable = c('Flux~(g~m^-2~s^-1)', 'Mass~(g)'))
ggplot(mydata, aes(y = y)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, labeller = label_parsed)
```

### Putting it all together

* For multi-panel plots, I like to "beef up" my plots using the [cowplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/index.html) package in R. It has an intuitive way to arrange panels and add annotation labels, which is described in one of the package's [vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/plot_grid.html). 

The basic idea is to initiate an empty drawing canvas with the `ggdraw()` function, and then determined the location and sizing of each panel with `draw_plot()` functions. 

If you have 4 ggplot objects called panel_a, panel_b, panel_c, and panel_d, creating a 4-panel figure with labels would look something like this:

```
figure <- ggdraw() +
  draw_plot(panel_a, x = 0, y = .5, width = 0.4, height = 0.5) +
  draw_plot(panel_b, x = .4, y = .5, width = 0.6, height = 0.5) +
  draw_plot(panel_c, x = 0, y = 0, width = 0.4, height = 0.5) +
  draw_plot(panel_d, x = .4, y = 0, width = 0.6, height = 0.5) +
  draw_plot_label(label = c("a", "b", "c", "d"), x = c(0, 0.4, 0, 0.4), y = c(1,1, 0.5, 0.5), size = 15)
```
The arguments for the draw_plot function are: 

* **plot**: the plot to place (ggplot2 or a gtable)
* **x**: The x location of the lower left corner of the plot.
* **y**: The y location of the lower left corner of the plot.
* **width, height**: the width and the height of the plot

There is also a handy function for saving this type of plot to a file: 

```
save_plot("figure.png", figure, ncol = 2, nrow = 2, base_aspect_ratio = 1.3)
```

As I haven't determined anything particulary bovine-related in the package, I'm pretty sure the name references the [author's](https://github.com/clauswilke) initials. 

* If you want a "stealth mode" plot that is all black with white lines and text, there is no built-in theme in ggplot and it's oddly hard to find a good white-on-black theme in any of the add-on packages that have customized themes.

The best one I have found is written by Jon Lefcheck and can be sourced directly from GitHub:

```{r warning=FALSE}
source('https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jslefche/eff85ef06b4705e6efbc/raw/736d3dc9fe71863ea62964d9132fded5e3144ad7/theme_black.R')

mydata <- data.frame(x=runif(100), y=runif(100), gp=letters[1:5])
ggplot(mydata,aes(x = x,y = y, color = gp)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme_black()
```
