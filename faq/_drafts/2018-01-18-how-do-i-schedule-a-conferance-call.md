SESYNC offers the ability for your group to schedule conference calls outside of your onsite meetings. These calls can either be dial-in only, or audio-video. To schedule a call, please contact SESYNC it staff __{{ site.email }}__ at least 7 days in advance of your call and we will configure a one time or standing meeting for you. Please let your participants know to keep a lookout for a meeting invitation from SESYNC's IT staff. After you schedule your call, the following will happen:

1. SESYNC IT staff will create a conference call and send all participants a meeting/calendar invitation to the meeting. This invite will containe connection instructions along with a unique conference code and meeting URL.
2. If requested, SESYNC IT staff will arrange testing of all remote participants to ensure their laptop/desktop setup will work with our conference software
3. On the day of your meeting, click on the link in the meeting invitation and connect to the meeting.
