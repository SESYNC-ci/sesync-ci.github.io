For new groups, we generally follow the timeline below:

1. **Day of priming call** - Shortly before or after your priming call, SESYNC IT staff will email a group's PIs letting them know that resources have been created for their group.

2. **One week before your first meeting** - All group members listed on your travel form will receive an email with instructions on setting up their account.

### Why don't you fully set up the group when you award?

The two big reasons we don't set up your group or notify your members further in advance: 
* First, unless there is a reason for your group members to have access to resources, most folks will disregard or misplace an email sent about a meeting several months in advance. 
* Second, we often see group members get added or changed leading up to the first meeting.

### Can I have access early if we need to share documents?

Yes, if you're starting your group virtually we will certainly set up your site early. Just drop our IT staff an email w/ the list of your group members and we'll take care of the rest.
