Navigate to <https://files.sesync.org> and log in with your SESYNC username and
password. The folders listed under "External storages" are each a shared
research data directory accessible to participants in the corresponding project.

To transfer files between your [research data directory] and home directory (`/research-home/myusername`),
you will need to use an alternative method of access such as SSH 
or the RStudio server's file manager interface. 
You cannot access your home directory from [files.sesync.org](https://files.sesync.org).
Our [cyber resources infographic] shows the relationship between the home and data directories.

For more ways to access, see the [research data directory] quickstart guide.
