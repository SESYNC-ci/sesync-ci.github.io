SESYNC has five conference rooms and a large breakout space equipped with HD screens, projectors, whiteboards and an array of collaborative tools. 
Please note, depending on the size and requests of your group, your assigned meeting room may have a different table arrangement that waht is show in the pictures below.

**End of Day Considerations**
* At the end of the day, please place all dishes or cups you may have brought into your room in the sink located in the open space and dispose of all trash.
* Please turn off all monitors and projectors that you may have used throughout the day.
* If you spill coffee or other things that may stain the carpet, please let SESYNC staff know immediately so we can take measures to prevent the stain from setting.

### Resource Guides
All conference rooms have a white guide book at the front explaining how to use the projectors, whiteboard capture and manage any remote participants you may have.
