The three are often a source of confusion.

## Git

Software that handles source code versioning, letting you make and track local
file changes and share changes with a remote repository.

## GitHub (i.e. <https://github.com>)

A cloud service for remote hosting of git repositories. In addition to hosting
your code, the site helps manage software development projects with features like
issue tracking, collaborating with other GitHub users, and hosting web pages.

GitHub offers free services for open source projects (accessible to the public) and
paid tiers for private projects. For public projects, anyone can see code you push to
GitHub and offer suggestions, or even code, to improve your project. GitHub currently
hosts the source code for tens of thousands of open source projects, but is not alone.
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) and [GitLab.com](https://about.gitlab.com) offer
comparable services.

## GitLab (i.e. <https://gitlab.sesync.org>)

GitLab (a cloud service a lot like GitHub) comes in two flavors, a publicly available
[cloud service](https://gitlab.com/users/sign-in) and a cloud service for SESYNC science
teams. Use the SESYNC server <https://gitlab.sesync.org> to host private projects shareable
with other SESYNC users.
