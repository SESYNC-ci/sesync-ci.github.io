There are several resources available for collaborative writing depending on which platform you prefer to work. These are the resources
SESYNC groups have successfully used in the past.

### [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)
For word processing, Google Docs is the most used collaborative platform. Multiple users can work on the platform simultaneously
and you can customize group settings and user privileges.

### [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
Overleaf allows for multiple users to work in LaTeX. It is free for a single user, but there is a subscription fee to add multiple users.
A subscription also allows you to sync with Dropbox and GitHub.

### [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/)
Another free option, HackMD is a great option for working in Markdown. Multiple users can work simultaneously and you can also sync
to Dropbox and GitHub to streamline your workflow.

### [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
Zotero is a free reference manager. SESYNC can help your group set up a shared library for your project. Google Docs also supports Zotero for creating citations.
