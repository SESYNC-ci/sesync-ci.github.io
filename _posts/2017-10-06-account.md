Anyone who is a PI on a science team, or is part of a long running
pursuit, will receive an e-mail with instructions on completing
account setup prior to their first meeting.

If you haven't received account information, or were added late to a
science team, please fill out our
[new account request form](http://www.sesync.org/new-account-request).
