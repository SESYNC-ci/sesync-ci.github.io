We're starting to roll out a scheduled linux cluster for groups that
need a little more horsepower than is available from a single virtual
machine. To make this service as easy to use as possible we've
designed the cluster to be accessible traditionally (via ssh) and also
have extensively tested it using our R Studio Server. What this means
is you use your web browser and R Studio to test code and submit it to
our cluster.

If you're intersted in using this service, please take a look at the
following guides we've put together:
