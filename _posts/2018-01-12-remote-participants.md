## Onsite Meetings with Remote Participants

When you submit your travel planner to our travel office, please make sure to include a list of all remote participants that will be joining your meeting.
You may add participants after the 8 week deadline but we require that you notify us of all participants at least one week befor ethe start of the meeting.

### Testing and notifying remote participants

The week before your meeting, our technical staff will reach out to all the remote to arrange testing (if they haven't connected before) and will send them a meeting invitation with connection instructions. 
If you would let those participants know to expect contact from us it will help the process. During the testing, we will make sure they have a working camera and microphone and make note of any issues that may arise. 
If the remote particiapant needs to share slides or other content, that will be tested as well.

### Meeting Day

SESYNC IT staff will make sure that your meeting room is connected to the videoconference prior to your arrival. We will place a laptop in the room that is also connected to the room projectors, the videoconference and has screen sharing enabled. We recommend you load all presentations on to this laptop, or use the laptop to connect to your collaboration site to retrieve your presentations.

All of our meeting rooms also have [whiteboard capture devices](http://cyberhelp.sesync.org/quickstart/Using-eBeam.html) that can be shared with the remote participants. There is a help card in the room with instructions on how to use the technology. If you have any questions, feel free to ask any of our IT staff for help

## Virtual Group Meetings

We are able to schedule fully virtual meetings for our working groups at any time while your project is in progress. Please contact us at least 5 business days prior so that we may contact and test with all of your participants.

1. Send our IT staff (cyberhelp@sesync.org) a request which contains the following:
   * Date, Time and duration of your meeting.
   * List of the participants, names and email addresses.
   * Would you like us to perform a test call with your participants prior to the meeting. We highly recommend this for video conferences and conferences which involve shared content.
2. Our IT Staff will send you and your participants a meeting invite which will contain a link for connecting to the meeting.
3. If requested, we will test with all aprticipants who have not used our video conference system in the past.
