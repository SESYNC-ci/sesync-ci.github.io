> *There are a variety of visualization options available to help scientific teams create and share a collective vision of their research project.  The development of these visualizations can promote deep learning and engagement by transcending verbal and written boundaries across diverse perspectives within a team.  These visuals allow groups to communicate complex socio-environmental concepts among the team, scientific community and public sphere.*

# Popular Visualization Options 

The choice of visualization tools for a scientific team depends on the goals and outcomes that the visual aims to achieve within a research project.  Here are some different visualization options to help teams throughout all stages of the research process: 

## Mind Mapping 

Mind maps allow research teams to create a free-form and non-linear visual to explore a concept and its relating ideas.  These maps allow teams to brainstorm a topic and are relatively informal.  

The map is constructed with a topic or image in the center which is connected to relating thoughts or information that expand outwardly using a radial hierarchy.  Commonly, visual elements can be employed throughout the mind map such as color coding, pictures and diagrams that help to build conceptual relationships and aid in comprehension.

**Stage of Research Process:**  
Mind mapping is most commonly used during the beginning stages of a project.  However, it is not limited to the start of a research endeavor.  This active brainstorming process can be useful at any stage where the team feels stuck, is looking to bring a new perspective to the problem, or may be searching for an opportunity to generate new and unexpected ideas. 

**Advantages:**<br />
This is a creative and unstructured way of brainstorming that is relatively quick and easy to learn.

**Disadvantages:**<br />
Mind maps are limited in their ability to articulate highly complex relationships.  Therefore, it is useful for teams trying to explain one unique concept but they don’t have the capacity to explore the interrelatedness of various concepts.

## Concept Mapping 
Concept maps are linear and structured visualizations used by teams to outline the relationships between various concepts central to a research question. These maps provide a more precise look at the linkages between related concepts in a formally organized way. 

A concept map begins with a word or idea related to a focus question, situated at the top of the map, that the diagram aims to answer.  The map then subsequently lays out all related concepts that are enclosed in circles or square boxes.  These relational concepts are connected through arrows defined by linking text (prepositional phrases) that explain how each idea is associated to one another.  These linking relationships can be hierarchical (downward arrows) or they can be moving in all directions.

**Stage of Research Process:**  
Concept maps are useful as part of a project's initial scoping activities but are also ever-evolving.  As the project develops and new linkages are discovered it is important to update the concept map so it continues to serves the project from beginning to end. 

**Advantages:**<br />
Its ability to display relational links between relevant concepts can be especially useful for capturing the complex dynamics and systems relevant to socio-environmental research. 

**Disadvantages:**<br />
Concept maps are a rigorous and structured tool that have a learning curve. In addition, although they are designed to explicitly identify related concepts, these maps are limited in their ability to describe the complexity of those relationships in detail.

## Infographics

An infographic is a collection of charts, diagrams, or illustrations that visually present information in a clear and attention-grabbing way.  Infographics are especially useful for communicating complex ideas to an audience who may not have experience or expertise in that subject. Research teams use infographics as a science communications product to present their research problem, outcomes and/or goals.  

Here are some guiding questions to consider when creating an infographic: 

* Who is your audience? 
* What is the goal of the infographic? 
* What is the optimum level of complexity? 
* What narrative are you trying to tell? 

The answers to these questions will help your team outline the foundation of your infographic and are key to communicating socio-environmental concepts in a visual format.  

**Stage of Research Process:**  
It is helpful for teams to develop a communications strategy at the start of their project rather than as an end stage activity.  The infographic’s content will progress with the research project so choosing this product at the outset will help to direct ideas and inspiration for the infographic. 

**Advantages:**<br />
An infographic can bring your research to life and convey complex topics to an audience who may not have expertise in that subject.  Therefore, it is great for building bridges between science, community and action. 

**Disadvantages:**<br />
It is time consuming to create a high-quality infographic and it requires experience with or interest in learning about design and science communication.

# Software Options 

Although the popularity of displaying complex information visually is not new, the development of user-friendly software tools to create maps and graphics easily has been rapidly expanding.  The creation of these visuals using software means that they are more easily updated, reproduced and shared widely.  

Here are some popular software options to consider: 

| Software   | Visualization Options | Accessibility | User Experience |
